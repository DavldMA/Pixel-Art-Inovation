# Pixel-Art-Inovation
Pixel art inovation is a program inspired on [aarthificial unity Pixel Art Inovation](https://youtu.be/HsOKwUwL1bE). What it does is automate your work when you want to change the skin of a sprite and multiple sprites with a little bit of less work. Obviously, once you make the "UV map" of the sprite, future times you use the program will be much easier.

This is my first submission on github, and I am pretty new at coding, so please don't judge my code too harshly, but I am accepting recommendations and, obviously, critics in order to make my code better.

# üöÄ Features
- :space_invader: Change the color of multiple sprites
- :paintbrush: Change the color with multiple color palletes
- :floppy_disk: Saves the files used in the previous execution on the files

# üíª Tutorial
After downloading the files and uploading it to your editor, you can execute it as a normal python file, once it already have some default files, it will produce 6 outputs, with a random sprite with different colors and different sprites. 

*Future example image*

For you to be able to make your sprite work in this program, first you need to UV Map your sprite manually, you can UV Map multiple sprites and upload them all, in order to change the color of the whole animation, next you need to make something like a model with a UV Map, just like the sprite, where the code can know what the head is, what the hair is, etc. After that you need to upload the model again, but this time with colors, its here where you can put multiple skins here in order to generate multiple sprites.

*Future image explaining what file it is*

This is a brief explanation, if you did not understand anything, or something, I recommend you to check the [channel of the original idea creator](https://youtu.be/nYch_TIkq6w), once my code works in a very similar way. In a near future I will make a video as well explaining more in depth of this program and maybe doing a tutorial.

*Future video embed?*

## Missing Libraries
If there are any missing libraries error, please run this on your terminal:
```
pip install Pillow
pip install colorama
pip install tqdm
pip install tk
```

# üñäÔ∏è Future Updates
I won't update this much, if I update it will be:
- Bug fixing
- Add a proper UI
- New features
- Auto libraries installer
- Code optimization
- If possible try to make it more automatic
